Include the canu command used, or at least tell us what options you've set.

Include the output of `canu -version` if it isn't in any outputs.  It's reported at the start of the logging, and just before any crash report.

FORMATTING TIPS:

Use `single backtics` to highlight words in text.
```

This preserves

       bizarre
    formatting
```
Use the `Preview` button just above this space to see what the issue will look like.
